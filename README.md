## Welcome to AI Lab in PKU!

We are insterested in game AI, and we have an open game AI platform, [Botzone](www.botzone.org.cn)!

Botzone is a universal online multi-agent game AI platform, designed to evaluate different implementations of game AI by applying them to agents and compete with each other, featuring an ELO ranking system and a contest system for users to evaluate their AI programs.

Up to January 2020, we have 8058 users enrolled on Botzone.

The available languages on Botzone are C/C++, Java, C#, JavaScript (Node.js), Python. We also added machine learning libraries for Python, as well as the ability to save and load model data globally. 

This platform is publicly available on the internet currently, and we are eager to collaborate with organizations to provide more games, functions, and suggestions to support AI education and research.

We collected several game AI competitions here, including [FightGame](http://www.ice.ci.ritsumei.ac.jp/~ftgaic/), [Poker](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~pokert/) ([site2](https://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/news.html), [site3](http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/)), [SCRC](http://torcs.sourceforge.net/index.php?name=News&page=1)([site2](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~optlog/SCR2015/)), [StarCraft](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~dchurchill/starcraftaicomp/index.shtml) ([site2](http://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/rts-competition/start)), etc. The resources and links are given in this repo.
